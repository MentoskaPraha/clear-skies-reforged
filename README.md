# Clear Skies Reforged
An updated fork of the [Clear Skies](https://modrinth.com/mod/xNK6XfRv) mod adapted for the Quilt Modloader. This is a tiny mod that removes the banding at the horizon of Vanilla Minecraft. [Clear Skies](https://modrinth.com/mod/xNK6XfRv) was originally developed by grongad and I've only adapted his code to work with Quilt and my workflow.

## Supported Versions
At the current moment the mod only supports `1.19.2` with `1.20.1` being planned. If you want to see another version supported feel free to open an issue, however versions older than `1.19` won't be supported, so don't ask.

## Supported Modloaders
Quilt and Quilt only. If you wanna port the mod it's your right to do so, but I won't. Also the mod is only tested for the `0.21.2` version of Quilt, but should it should work just fine on newer versions. It won't work on older versions though.

## Dependancies
None. You just need the mod loader.

## Branches
The source code in the main branch is for the latest supported Minecraft version. Source code for older versions of Minecraft can be found in the branch named after that version. If a branch doesn't exist for the version of Minecraft you want, it isn't supported. If you want a certain version to be supported feel free to open an issue, but again versions older than `1.19` won't be supported, so don't ask.
