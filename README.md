# Quilted Clear Skies
An updated fork of the [Clear Skies](https://modrinth.com/mod/xNK6XfRv) mod adapted for the Quilt Mod-loader. This is a tiny mod that removes the banding at the horizon of Vanilla Minecraft. [Clear Skies](https://modrinth.com/mod/xNK6XfRv) was originally developed by [grongad](https://modrinth.com/user/ZBrRFLVK), and I've only adapted his code to work with Quilt and will continue to maintain it into the future.

## Supported Versions
This mod is for Minecraft `1.1.2` only.
I'll update it to a newer version later. Only one version will be maintained ever. No backport support is provided. Feel free to fork the project and backport any changes, simple update the versions in [gradle.properties](gradle.properties).

## Dependencies
None. You just need the mod loader (version `0.23.1` or greater).
