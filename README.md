# Quilted Clear Skies
An updated fork of the [Clear Skies](https://modrinth.com/mod/xNK6XfRv) mod adapted for the Quilt Modloader. This is a tiny mod that removes the banding at the horizon of Vanilla Minecraft. [Clear Skies](https://modrinth.com/mod/xNK6XfRv) was originally developed by [grongad](https://modrinth.com/user/ZBrRFLVK) and I've only adapted his code to work with Quilt and the latest version of Minecraft (`1.20.2`).

## Supported Versions
This mod is for Minecraft `1.19` to the newest version.

## Dependancies
None. You just need the mod loader (version `0.21.0` or greater).
